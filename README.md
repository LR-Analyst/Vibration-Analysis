### Description:
The following is a Jupyter notebook used to analyze floor vibrations via data collected from accelerometers. This particular case was a response to complaints of floor vibrations in an office space. The issue was identified as a piece of mechanical equipment, which is represented by the peak in the third plot (1/3 octave bands). After the equipment mount was modified, the peak drastically diminished in the follow-up analysis proving the repair was effective.
